# Deep-learning-based-feature-importance-ranking-for-DNA-methylation-data-in-breast-cancer-risk-strati
Several studies demonstrated a correlation of DNA methylation with cancer risk, but it is still uncertain which altered CpG sites are relevant risk indicators. Thanks to the Italian part of the EPIC project, we wish to discover the most important methylation features for detecting breast cancer risk several years before the diagnosis, in order to conduct targeted interventions on patients. Investigating data science techniques in this context is complex: the high dimensionality, non-linear interactions and interpretability are tough challenges to deal with. In order to overcome these problems, we introduce a novel deep learning survival methodology, based on feature clustering, followed by a deep survival layer-wise pre-trained model, and then an adequate feature importance algorithm derived from SHAP. Our proposal outperforms the competitor methodologies and provides meaningful insights on the DNA methylation relation with breast cancer risk.
